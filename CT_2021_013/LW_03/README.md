# Lab Worksheet 3: Defining Classes

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains solutions to **Lab Worksheet 3: Defining Classes**, which focuses on creating Java classes, working with constructors, getter/setter methods, and implementing object-oriented principles.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

## 📝 Lab Tasks
### 🔹 **Question 1 & 2: Temperature Class**
- **Q1:** Create a `Temperature` class that stores a temperature in Celsius.
  - Provides methods to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
  - Accepts user input in Celsius and converts to Fahrenheit.
- **Q2:** Modify the above class to accept Fahrenheit as input and convert it to Celsius.

### 🔹 **Question 3: Circle Class**
- Create a `Circle` class with:
  - `setRadius()` method to set the radius.
  - `computeArea()` method to compute the area.
  - `computeCircumference()` method to compute the circumference.
- Implement a Java program to compute the area of a circular region given two radii.

### 🔹 **Question 4: Bicycle Class with Owner Object**
- Modify the `Bicycle` class to store an `Owner` object instead of just a name and phone number.
- The `Owner` class has:
  - `ownerName` (String)
  - `phoneNo` (String)

### 🔹 **Question 5: University Course Registration System**
- Implement a system using four classes:
  - `Course`: Stores course name, course code, and lecturer.
  - `Lecturer`: Stores lecturer name and the course they teach.
  - `Student`: Stores student name, degree name, and enrolled course.
  - `Main`: Creates objects and assigns necessary properties.
